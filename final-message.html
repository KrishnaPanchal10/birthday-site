     Happy Birthday Diyaaaa 🥳❤️
      <br><br>
     You’ve been with me through thick and thin… and also through my most stupid decisions without judging me 
     (okay you judged a little, but you stayed 😭😂).
      <br><br>
      Thanks for being my best friend, my full-time supporter, 
      and my personal “secret keeper” since day 1 🥹🥹
      <br><br>
      May your birthday be as amazing as you are, and may your life be full of happiness, success, 
      and less drama (but not too less… warna boring ho jayega 😭😂).
